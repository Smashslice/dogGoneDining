### How we worked together
We started the day by making a basic wireframe of each page and discussing how we would handle responsiveness. We started by splitting up the workload and picking areas we were strong in. Then we started work on the actual site. As we worked, we used Microsoft's Live Share extension in vs code and github to keep our individual work together. Any time we made large changes, we would pause and assess the changes together and decide if it matched what we wanted. If it did, we moved on, if it did not we discussed changes until we were happy with the outcome. 

After each paid was laid out, we went back over each together and fixed any issues that we found. We then made some changes to improve cohesion and fix some styling errors.

Overall, we communicated throughout the project and shared information and progress as we went so that we were always on the same page.
